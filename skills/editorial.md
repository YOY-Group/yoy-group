# YOY Editorial System

## 1) Editorial North Star
YOY content should feel like it was written **after the hype cycle**, not during it.

The reader should think:
> “This feels considered. It doesn’t need me to agree immediately.”

Editorial ≠ marketing  
Editorial = **recording how the system thinks**

## 2) Core Editorial Principles
All writing must satisfy at least **two** of the following:

- Clarifies a concept
- Documents a decision
- Defines a boundary
- Records a method
- Explains a trade-off

If it does none → delete.

## 3) Sentence Architecture
Default rhythm:
- Short sentence.
- Short sentence.
- One longer synthesis sentence.

Example:
> YOY is not an agency.  
> It does not sell retainers by default.  
> It designs operating systems where brand, software, and distribution are treated as a single surface.

Avoid:
- Overly poetic metaphors
- Excessive parentheses
- Emojis
- Exclamation points

## 4) Paragraph Rules
- 2–4 sentences per paragraph.
- One idea per paragraph.
- Blank space is intentional.

Dense text reduces authority.

## 5) Voice Characteristics
Tone is:
- calm
- slightly distant
- precise
- non-performative

The voice should feel closer to:
- a research note,
- a design memo,
- a private briefing,

than to a blog post.

## 6) Headlines & Section Titles
Headlines should:
- state what the section *is*, not what it *promises*.
- avoid cleverness.
- read cleanly out of context.

Good:
- “Authority Model”
- “What This System Touches”
- “Constraints and Trade-offs”

Bad:
- “Why We’re Different”
- “The Future of Retail”
- “How to Win”

## 7) Editorial Hierarchy
Preferred structure:

1. Title (what this is)
2. Context (why it exists)
3. Definition (what it means)
4. Mechanism (how it works)
5. Implications (what it changes)
6. Status (now / later / not yet)

Not every page needs all six — but the order matters.

## 8) Time Signaling
YOY writing is **time-aware**.

Use:
- version numbers
- “currently”
- “in development”
- “not yet public”
- dates where appropriate

This signals honesty and reduces overclaiming.

## 9) Repetition Is a Feature
Key ideas should repeat across pages using the **same language**.

This is intentional.
It creates:
- internal consistency,
- semantic authority,
- machine-readability (SEO/AEO/GEO).

Do not rephrase for novelty.

## 10) Editorial Boundaries
YOY does NOT:
- explain basics to beginners,
- chase search traffic with thin posts,
- write opinion pieces without structure,
- publish speculative hype without constraints.

Silence is acceptable.

## 11) Agent Writing Constraints
When agents generate content:
- default to under-writing,
- prefer removing words to adding them,
- flag uncertainty instead of smoothing it.

Agents should ask:
> “Would this still hold up in 12 months?”

If unsure → mark as draft or omit.

## 12) Canon vs Surface
Some writing is **canon** (doctrines, glossary, index).  
Some writing is **surface** (home, services, contact).

Canon:
- slow to change,
- versioned,
- referenced.

Surface:
- minimal,
- directional,
- subordinate to canon.

Never let surface copy contradict canon.
