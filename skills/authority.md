# YOY Authority Doctrine

## 1) North Star
YOY.Group should feel like:
- a **holding structure**, not a startup,
- a **systems lab**, not an agency,
- a **quiet operator**, not a loud narrator.

Authority is expressed through:
**clarity, structure, restraint, and proof-of-thinking**.

## 2) Authority Model (how credibility is built)
YOY authority is layered, not shouted.

Layer 1 — **Language**
- Precise vocabulary.
- No filler.
- No “we believe” unless followed by a mechanism.

Layer 2 — **Structure**
- Pages are organized like briefs, not blogs.
- Clear sections, consistent naming, predictable navigation.

Layer 3 — **Continuity**
- Ideas recur across pages using the same terms.
- Pillars, glossary, and services reinforce each other.

Layer 4 — **Proof**
- Proof can be conceptual, not only commercial.
- Frameworks, models, diagrams, and constraints count as proof.

## 3) Tone Rules (non-negotiable)
- Declarative, calm, slightly distant.
- Short sentences. Occasional long ones for synthesis.
- No emojis.
- No motivational language.
- No “disruption” talk.

Bad:
> “We’re redefining the future of AI-powered commerce.”

Good:
> “We design retail operating systems where brand, software, and distribution move as one.”

## 4) Vocabulary Discipline
Use a **controlled vocabulary**:
- system
- layer
- protocol
- operating model
- architecture
- constraint
- distribution
- governance
- proof
- ritual
- surface

Avoid:
- revolutionary
- game-changing
- next-gen
- cutting-edge
- scalable (unless quantified)
- world-class

## 5) Page-Level Authority Patterns
Every serious page should answer, implicitly:
1) What is this?
2) Why does it exist?
3) How does it work?
4) Where does it sit in the system?
5) What proof exists (now or later)?

If a page cannot answer at least 3 of these, it is decorative and should be removed.

## 6) Homepage Authority Rules
The homepage is not a pitch.
It is a **map of competence**.

Homepage should:
- state what YOY is (1 sentence),
- show the system (pillars/index),
- signal restraint (“preview”, “v0”, “early” is acceptable),
- invite qualified contact, not mass signups.

## 7) Services Page Authority
Services are framed as **capabilities**, not offers.

Rules:
- No pricing tables (yet).
- No promises of outcomes.
- Focus on:
  - what systems are designed,
  - what layers are touched,
  - what constraints are enforced.

Clients should feel:
> “If we engage them, it will be serious.”

## 8) Proof Without Case Studies
Until real clients are public:
- Use frameworks.
- Use operating diagrams.
- Use internal experiments (clearly labeled).
- Use “in development” markers.

This signals honesty and long-term thinking.

## 9) Governance as Authority
Authority increases when constraints are visible.

Include:
- version numbers (v0.1, v0.2),
- roadmaps (even abstract),
- doctrines (this folder),
- clear scope boundaries (“YOY does not do X”).

## 10) Consistency Tests (agent checklist)
A page passes authority review if:
- It could be read aloud without sounding promotional.
- A skeptical operator would not roll their eyes.
- It feels closer to a **white paper** than a landing page.
- It creates confidence through subtraction, not addition.

## 11) Reference archetypes (feeling, not copying)
- Holding companies
- Architecture studios
- Editorial journals
- Research labs
- Private investment memos
