Scope: multi-market fashion retail (anonymised).

Constraints: cross-border, seasonal peaks, service-level risk.

System installed:

- Selection criteria + evaluation rubric (high-level).
- SLA framework + escalation boundaries (no clauses published).
- Cutover plan + controls + exception handling cadence.

Artifacts (names only): checklist, KPI sheet, weekly exception log, comms template.

Outcome lens: service level, lead time stability, cost-to-serve, returns friction.

Note: no thresholds, rubrics, or clauses are published here.
