Objective: stop decision drift and make performance management executable.

System installed:

- Weekly trading meeting OS (agenda + owners + follow-ups).
- Decisions log + actions register.
- KPI sheet (sell-through, OOS rate, markdown control, conversion).

Artifacts (names only): agenda, KPI sheet, decisions log, owner map.

Outcome lens: faster decisions, fewer repeated discussions, tighter execution accountability.
