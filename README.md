# YOY.Group

**YOY.Group** is an authority library and operating surface for autonomous, culture-led consumer systems.

This repository powers the public-facing YOY.Group site — not as a marketing page, but as a structured body of work: principles, proof, and operating language.

---

## What This Is

YOY.Group exists to document and demonstrate how modern consumer ventures are built when:

- automation is native
- culture is treated as infrastructure
- operations are designed as systems, not workflows

The site functions as:
- an **editorial library**
- a **proof archive**
- a **quiet signal** to founders, operators, and institutions

If something does not increase trust, it does not ship.

---

## Information Architecture

The site is organized around **authority primitives**, not funnels.

### Core Sections

- **Home**  
  Orientation and signal. No persuasion.

- **/pillars**  
  Stable operating principles. Slow to change.

- **/index**  
  Time-bound snapshots (quarterly / annual).

- **/proof**  
  Build logs, experiments, execution evidence.

- **/glossary**  
  Canonical definitions. Language as infrastructure.

- **/services**  
  Quiet B2B surface. Opt-in only.

- **/trust**  
  Editorial policy, corrections, disclosure.

---

## Design & Editorial Principles

- Calm over loud  
- Structure over decoration  
- Precision over volume  
- Whitespace is intentional  
- Authority is earned, not claimed  

The site is designed to survive being read aloud.

---

## Technical Stack

- **Next.js (App Router)**
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **shadcn/ui**
- Minimal dependencies by design

No tracking.  
No dark patterns.  
No speculative tooling.

---

## Agents & Skills

This repository is governed by an explicit agent charter and constraint system:

- `AGENTS.md` — agent role, rules, and definition of done  
- `skills/` — aesthetic, editorial, and authority constraints  

Agents must obey these documents.  
Deletion is preferred over invention.

---

## Status

- Authority layer: **v0.1**
- Public, intentionally incomplete
- Updated deliberately, not frequently

January releases will expand content — not tone.

---

## Non-Goals

This project does **not** aim to:
- chase virality
- optimize for funnels
- mimic other studios or holding pages
- over-index on SEO at the expense of clarity

Authority compounds slowly.  
The system reflects that.

---

## Governance

This repository is public by necessity.  
Sensitive systems, credentials, and operational infrastructure are not stored here.

Corrections and material updates are documented via the **/trust** section.
